### Derinkuyu

A rudimentary city-building game made for a C++ independent project with [Libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod), inspired by [the Derinkuyu underground city in Turkiye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs-zATBh_Ho).

#### To-Do
- Rewrite pathfinding
- Fix bug with teleporting water flow
- Add better lighting; shade based on exposure to surface rather than just by depth
- Simplify tile display by just printing over background instead of handling background separately every time
