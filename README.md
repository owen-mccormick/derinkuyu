### Derinkuyu

A rudimentary base-building game made for a C++ independent project with [Libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod). The gameplay aims to be a humble imitation of Oxygen Not Included and Dwarf Fortress, styled after the the Derinkuyu underground city site in Turkiye and the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde National Park.

#### To-Do
- Add dynamic "lighting" / tile background shading
- Make wagon demolishable
- Different biomes, both on surface (flat land, cliffs, rock chimneys...) and underground (groundwater, caverns, lava...)
- Ore veins
- Farming, food, and irrigation systems
- Defenses and enemy raids
- Trading system
- Animals and wildlife
- Changing weather and day / night cycle
- Make chopping / building non-instantaneous
