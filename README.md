### Derinkuyu

A rudimentary city-building game made for a C++ independent project with [Libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod), inspired by [the Derinkuyu underground city in Turkiye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs-zATBh_Ho).

#### Fixes To-Do
- Rewrite pathfinding
- Fix bug with teleporting water flow
- Redo water to use the material class rather than having a number per tile
- Fix entities being able to fall on top of each other and end up sharing the same tile
- Up and down cells should be neighbors if on ladder
