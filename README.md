### Derinkuyu

A rudimentary base-building game made for a C++ independent project with [Libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod). The gameplay aims to be a humble imitation of Oxygen Not Included and Dwarf Fortress, styled after the the Derinkuyu underground city site in Turkiye.

#### To-Do
- Irrigation systems and multiple cultivable plants
- Changing weather
- Different biomes, both on surface (flat land, cliffs, rock chimneys...) and underground (groundwater, caverns, lava...)
- Animals and wildlife
- Make chopping / building non-instantaneous
- Make wagon demolishable
- Defenses and enemy raids
- Add dynamic "lighting" / tile background shading
- Replace global inventory with tracking of actual item objects that can be moved and stored on particular tiles
